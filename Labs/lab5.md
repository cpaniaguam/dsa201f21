# This is Lab 5: Linear Models

To be completed 11/10/2021 in class. Refer to chapter 16 and the [notebook from last time](https://github.com/cpaniaguam/dsa201f21/blob/main/linear_models/linear_models.Rmd) as needed.

## Background and context (just read this and make sure you understand it)

To understand possible relationships among the variables in our data, linear regression is always a solid first step in this direction.

## Tasks

0.  Inspect the Body Measurements data set (data [here](https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/bdims.csv), description of variables [here](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=bdims)).
1. 	Is there a relationship between height and [shoulder girth](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hyegjoo-Choi-Rokas/publication/273134617/figure/fig19/AS:294657750781957@1447263290922/Shoulder-Circumference-measurement_Q640.jpg)?
2. 	Describe the relationship (if any) between shoulder girth and height.
3.  Will the relantionship change if shoulder girth was measured in inches while the units of height remained in centimeters?
4.  Find the mean height and the mean shoulder girth.
5.  Find the R-squared betweeen height and shoulder girth. Is this relationship weak, moderate, or strong?
6.  Write the equation for the linear model with height as response and shoulder girth as predictor.
7.  Interpret the slope and intercept in this context.
8.  What is the predicted height for a person whose shoulder girth is the average shoulder girth?
9.  A randomly selected Salve student is chosen; their shoulder girth is 100 cm. Predict this student's height using the model.
10.  Suppose this student's height is 175 cm. Calculate the residual and provide an interpretation of this value.
11.  A one year old baby has a shoulder girth of 60 cm. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?
12.  Does this sample provide strong evidence that an increase in shoulder girth is associated with an increase in height? State the *null* and *alternative hypotheses,* report the p-value, and state your conclusion.
