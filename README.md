# DSA-201 Intro to Data Science and Analytics, Fall 2021

## Meetings

M/W 4:00 PM - 5:15 PM

You may think of this course as being in a book club: We will have weekly readings to read or videos to watch (all posted on Canvas) and afterwards we get together to engage in ***active discussion*** of those readings/videos. Thus it is very important that every participant comes to the meetings already having read/watched the assigned readings/videos for that week.

## Instructor

Carlos Paniagua, [carlos.paniagua\@salve.edu](mailto:carlos.paniaguamejia@salve.edu). You can also reach me on Teams. Please use email for administrative issues (reporting missing class before it happens) and Microsoft Teams for all other *quick* consultations regarding the course. For more in-depth consultations see [Piazza](piazza.com/salve/fall2021/sta17306/home) and the following.

## Open hours

These are times we can meet one-on-one. You can see me after class or by appointment.

## Description

Computers are everywhere around us. They can perform many useful tasks a lot faster and more efficienty than any human. Code is what allows humans to control these machines to do amazing things for us. We communicate instructions to a computer via a *programming language.* The ability to control computers in this fashion will make you a much more productive and competitive citizen of today's complex society.

This course is a no-prerequisite introduction to computer programming in a high-level object-oriented programming language. We will use the very popular Python programming language (3x version). From the course catalog: Topics include input/output, assignment, computation, data types, branching and selection, repetition, functions, recursion, exception handling, array-like structures, object-oriented design, algorithmic complexity, algorithms and data structures, and plotting.

## Objectives

Upon completion of the course participants should be able to:

1. Understand the basic constructs in computer programming.
2. Design, write, and debug basic and useful programs in Python.
3. Understand more advanced computer programming techniques through independent study.

## Materials

The main resource will be [Foundations of Python Programming](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/index.html) via [Runestone Interactive](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/index).

Other useful resources also hosted at Runestone:

- [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html)
- [Python for Everybody - Interactive](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/py4e-int/index.html)
- Python documentation available at https://docs.python.org/3/
- Sometimes we want to do something very specific but we are kind of stuck. Chances are somebody else has been in a similar situation already. In these cases you could try a search on the Q&A site StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python

## Evaluation
Course assessment will consist of homework (including mini-projects), quizzes, and participation (yes, there are no high-stakes exams!). Standard letter-grade scale will apply. The breakdown is as follows.
- Weekly homework (40%, autograded). These will mostly consist of exercises to develop coding muscle memory and are to be worked right on the online textbooks at Runestone.
- Mini-projects (40 %, about 6). Problem solving/interesting applications based on the concepts and techniques covered. These are to be worked on your own development environment (more on this below) and turned in to Canvas.
- Quizzes (10%, about 1 every week). Quick assessments to encourage participants to not fall behind.
- Participation (10 %, continuously throughout the semester). More on this below.

## Expectations

1.  Academic Integrity: All students are expected to accept and to abide by the values of honesty, integrity, and truthfulness in their academic pursuits. Sanctions for violations of academic honesty, such as plagiarism or cheating range from failure for the work involved to failure in the course. A record of violations and sanctions is maintained in the student's file. Any violation may result in dismissal from the University (Undergraduate Catalog). Academic honesty is taken seriously in this class. Students committing academic dishonesty will be subject to the consequences described in the Catalog as determined by the professor. In short, everything you turn in must be your own work!

    Examples of what is **not** OK to do:

         -   To let someone else see/copy your own work

         -   To fail to acknowledge in writing help given/received either from a person or otherwise

         -   To share files with other students

    Examples of what is OK (encouraged) to do:

         -   Discuss (talk about) general ideas with other students and with your instructor

2.  Before live meetings: That participants will come to live meetings having thoroughly read the assigned readings/watched assigned videos.

3.  During live meetings: I ask that participants will have their cameras on at all times and be actively engaged (for example, asking a lot of questions!) during discussions.
<!--- This is a comment-->
4.  After live meetings: To be engaged in asynchronous discussions on Piazza, a Q&A platform within Canvas. I expect participants to make **at least one contribution** (question, answer to a question, something interesting or useful you discovered, etc.) **every two weeks** in order to be in good participation standing.

Online format: Salve Regina University is committed to providing equal access for students with disabilities to all of its programs and services in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. If you have a disability that entitles you to instructional accommodations and/or modifications, you must register with the Office of Disability Services at the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) and arrange to provide them with documentation of your disability. You may do this in person (McKillop Library 2nd floor), electronically, or via regular mail (c/o Disability Services, Salve Regina University, 100 Ochre Point Ave., Newport, RI 02840). The office can be reached by phone at 401-341-3150 Monday-Friday 8:00-4:00 EST, or via email ([laura.barry\@salve.edu](mailto:laura.barry@salve.edu)). The Disability Services Office will provide you with letters of accommodation for your professors as appropriate to your disability needs. You will then arrange to speak with your professors as soon as possible to discuss arrangements for implementing your accommodations. Accommodations are never applied retroactively therefore it is important that you make your accommodation arrangements at least two weeks before you need them.\*\*Like so many things this Fall, the need for accommodations and the process for arranging them may be altered by the COVID-19 changes we are experiencing and the safety protocols currently in place.

## Use of Salve Email

Please note that all official email communication at Salve Regina University involving faculty, students, and staff is to be conducted using Salve email (addresses ending in \@salve.edu). Students must regularly check their Salve email for important notifications from their faculty, the Registrar, and others.

## Academic Support

The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) provides peer tutoring appointments that help students at all skill levels achieve academic success. Subject tutors review content and provide specific study strategies for courses in many disciplines. Writing consultants help any undergraduate student with every phase of the writing process from brainstorming to revision. ACE also offers mentorship, resources, workshops, and community-oriented programs.  For more information or to schedule an appointment, visit <https://salve.edu/academic-center-excellence> or call (401) 341-2226.

## Credit Hour

Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than:

(1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or

(2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.
