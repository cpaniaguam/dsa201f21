# DSA-201 Intro to Data Science and Analytics, Fall 2021

## Meetings

M/W 4:00 PM - 5:15 PM

You may think of this course as being in a book club: We will have weekly readings to read or videos to watch (all posted on Canvas) and afterwards we get together to engage in ***active discussion*** of those readings/videos. Thus it is very important that every participant comes to the meetings already having read/watched the assigned readings/videos for that week.

## Instructor

Carlos Paniagua, [carlos.paniagua\@salve.edu](mailto:carlos.paniaguamejia@salve.edu). You can also reach me on Teams. Please use email for administrative issues (reporting missing class before it happens) and Microsoft Teams for all other *quick* consultations regarding the course. For more in-depth consultations about course content see [Piazza](piazza.com/salve/fall2021/sta17306/home) and the following.

## Open hours

These are times we can meet one-on-one. You can see me after class or by appointment.

## Description

This course is a no-prerequisite introduction to the fundamental concepts, techniques, tools, and methods of data science and analytics. We will use the very popular R programming language for statistical analysis. From the course catalog: Topics include data collection and sampling in real-world problems, unstructured data, brief review of descriptive statistics and statistical plots, data transformations and missing data, visualization of multivariate data, clustering, univariate and multivariate regression, confirmatory data analysis.

## Objectives

Upon completion of the course participants should be able to:

- Understand fundamental concepts and characteristics of data.
- Design, write, and debug basic and useful programs in R and R-Studio for data management, analysis, and visualization.
- Understand principles and practices in data filtering, cleaning, and linking.
- Communicate results of data analyses to decision makers or stakeholders
- Adequately frame a data science problem: question formulation, data identification.
- Perform adequate transformations to data, including linking, aggregation, and summarization.
- Organize and manage data at various stages of project lifecycle 

## Student Profile

Although there are no formal prerrequisites to participate in this course, the ideal student should have

- A legitimate interest/curiosity in data science 
- Some curiosity about business, science, education, health, or another substantive area
- Basic computer skills, particularly around spreadsheets
- Familiarity with basic arithmetic, geometry, and trigonometry 
- Basic understanding of simple descriptive statistics
- Motivation to learn and achieve a high degree of professional preparation

## Materials

The main resource will be the textbook [Introduction to Data Science (2017), by Saltz & Stanton](https://www.bkstr.com/salvereginastore/course-materials-results?shopBy=course&divisionDisplayName=&departmentDisplayName=DSA&courseDisplayName=201&sectionDisplayName=01&programId=220&termId=100069000) (Required)

Other useful resources:

- R for Data Science (2017) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, O’Reilly. Web version at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/
- Introduction to Data Science Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R by Rafael A. Irizarry. Web version at https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/
- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) is a more classical apporach to statistics using today's techonology.
- Hands-On Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/ (for the basics of programming in R)
- Advanced R by Hadley Wickham available at https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html
- Sometimes we want to do something very specific but we are kind of stuck. Chances are somebody else has been in a similar situation already. In these cases you could try a search on the Q&A site StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/R. See also [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/).

## Evaluation
Course assessment will consist of homework, quizzes, participation, and projects. Standard letter-grade scale will apply. The breakdown is as follows.
- Homework (40%, about 1 every week) for practicing carrying out data processing, analysis, management, and communication.
- Projects (20 %, at least one). Problem solving/interesting applications based on the concepts and techniques covered. These are to be worked on your own development environment (more on this below) and turned in to Canvas.
- Quizzes (30%, about 3). Quick assessments to encourage participants to not fall behind.
- Participation (10%, continuously throughout the semester). More on this below.

## Expectations

1.  Academic Integrity: All students are expected to accept and to abide by the values of honesty, integrity, and truthfulness in their academic pursuits. Sanctions for violations of academic honesty, such as plagiarism or cheating range from failure for the work involved to failure in the course. A record of violations and sanctions is maintained in the student's file. Any violation may result in dismissal from the University (Undergraduate Catalog). Academic honesty is taken seriously in this class. Students committing academic dishonesty will be subject to the consequences described in the Catalog as determined by the professor. In short, everything you turn in must be your own work!

    Examples of what is **not** OK to do:

         -   To let someone else see/copy your own work

         -   To fail to acknowledge in writing help given/received either from a person or otherwise

         -   To share files with other students

    Examples of what is OK (encouraged) to do:

         -   Discuss (talk about) general ideas with other students and with your instructor

2.  Before live meetings: That participants will come to live meetings having thoroughly read the assigned readings/watched assigned videos.

3.  During live meetings: I ask that participants will have their cameras on at all times and be actively engaged (for example, asking a lot of questions!) during discussions.
<!--- This is a comment-->
4.  After live meetings: To be engaged in asynchronous discussions on Piazza, a Q&A platform within Canvas. I expect participants to make **at least one contribution** (question, answer to a question, something interesting or useful you discovered, etc.) **every two weeks** in order to be in good participation standing.
