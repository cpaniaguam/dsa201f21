# Project

## TL;DR

Choose any dataset and do something meaningful with it.

Full details below.

## Details

- To do: Do a data analysis on a dataset of your own choosing.
- Data could come from some source, or you may collect your own (via survey, experiment, or web scrapping).
- Suggestion: Choose data in alignment with your interests or based on work you've done in other courses or projects (of any type) you've worked on before.

## Goal

- Again, you should demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this course (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to an interesting dataset in a meaningful way.

- An exhaustive data analysis is *not* required. That is, you don't have to calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable.
- You should show you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and use data driven approaches to answer those questions leveraging computing in R.
- You should show you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results of your analysis.
- Tip: Let your research question(s) inform you about what methods can be most useful. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned. However, you can use techniques we haven't officially covered in class (be ready to answer questions about it!).
- You should discuss the limitations of your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. For example, you could discuss issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, the appropriateness of the statistical analysis you chose, scope of the results, etc.

## More details

- Open ended endeavor.
- You should create a few compelling visualization(s) of you data in R.
- There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use. Again, be ready to answer questions if you use packages we didn't learn in class.
- No need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations.
- All work must be produced using R in RStudio.

## Presentation
- A presentation of your analysis is required (15 to 20 minutes including questions) on the last day of classes.
- Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count.


## Data

- Choose a manageable and accessible dataset.
- Dataset should be large enough that multiple relationships can be explored.
- Minimum size: 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made with instructor approval).
- Data should be variagated in type: categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.
- :raising_hand: If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late :dizzy_face::scream:.
- Datasets used in class examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class will not count.
