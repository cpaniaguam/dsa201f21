# Project

## [TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)

### To do
Choose a dataset and show other people you can do something meaningful with it.
Report must include details of the data science pipeline: data collection, data wrangling, data understanding (including EDA), Inferential analysis (hypothesis testing) / modeling (machine learning).

### Deliverable
Link to a GitHub statically hosted page ([GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)) and presetation. 

### Grading
(A lot of inspiration for the grading came from [HC Bravo](https://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/projects/final_project/).)

A numeric score between 1 and 10 will be assigned for each of the following six criteria:

- Motivation. Speak to the importance/relevance of the effort in general and with respect to data science/analytics.
- Understanding. Does an uninformed reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the topic feel like s/he learned more about it?
- Other resources. Does the report link out to other resources (on the web, in books, etc) that would give a lagging reader additional help on specific topics, or an advanced reader the ability to dive more deeply into a specific application area or technique?
- Narrative. Does the report's prose add value to the content of the deliverable?
- Code. Is the code well written, well annotated, and reproducible? Does it help the reader understand the tutorial? Does it give good examples of specific techniques?
- Presentation

Full details below.

## Details
(Some inspiration came from [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/main/02-project.Rmd))

- To do: Do a data analysis on a dataset of your own choosing.
- Data could come from some source, or you may collect your own (via survey, experiment, or web scrapping).
- Suggestion: Choose data in alignment with your interests or based on work you've done in other courses or projects (of any type) you've worked on before.

## Goal

- Again, you should demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this course (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to an interesting dataset in a meaningful way.

- An exhaustive data analysis is *not* required. That is, you don't have to calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable.
- You should show you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and use data driven approaches to answer those questions leveraging computing in R.
- You should show you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results of your analysis.
- Tip: Let your research question(s) inform you about what methods can be most useful. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned. However, you can use techniques we haven't officially covered in class (be ready to answer questions about it!).
- You should discuss the limitations of your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. For example, you could discuss issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, the appropriateness of the statistical analysis you chose, scope of the results, etc.

## More details

- Open ended endeavor.
- You should create a few compelling visualization(s) of you data in R.
- There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use. Again, be ready to answer questions if you use packages we didn't learn in class.
- No need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations.
- All work must be produced using R in RStudio.

## Presentation
- A presentation of your analysis is required (10-15 minutes including questions) on the last day of classes.
- Neatness, coherence, and clarity will count.


## Data

- Choose a manageable and accessible dataset.
- Dataset should be large enough that multiple relationships can be explored.
- Minimum size: 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made with instructor approval).
- Data should be variagated in type: categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.
- :raising_hand: If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late :dizzy_face::scream:.
- Datasets used in class examples, homework assignments, or labs will not count. You must find your own data!
